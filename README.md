# measuring-interest

If you're interested in joining in Orlando Source Software, you can either reach me on ODev Slack @bgates, or open a pull request in this repo. In either case, please let me know:

* your ODev Slack handle (if you have one)
* any project you'd like to have forked
* whether you want to be a project maintainer
* your experience level (junior/mid/senior is sufficient)
* technologies you know
* technologies you'd like to work on

Thanks!
